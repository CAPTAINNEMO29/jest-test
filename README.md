Hello There!

this is my first repository with Jest

you will need to npm install and in the package.json to have something like this

{
  "name": "jest-testing",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "jest"
  },
  "keywords": [],
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
  "devDependencies": {
    "jest": "^26.1.0"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "axios": "^0.19.2"
  }
}

we will use axios in the functions.js and you will need to require axios or import.
